the uncompressed file is a collection of RECORDs.
Every RECORD has a one-byte header.
The low nibble is the RECORD TYPE.
The high nibble holds indication of the record length, with the following rule:
	high nibble>=4: subtract 4; that is the length
	high nibble <4: add 1: that is the number of bytes for the following length (in big-endian format)

As for the RECORD TYPE:
0 - one-byte specifier will follow, and the data next
1 - this is an ENTRY
2 - this is a NAMED REOURCE: the resource name will follow as above (e.g xxx.bmp, xxx.html) (and the data next)
3 - two byte specifier will follow, and the data next
6 - no specifier, 0 bytes of data - indicating beginning of entries
4 - no specifier, 0 bytes of data - eof

An ENTRY has 2 parts:
the HEADWORD as a string preceded by 1 byte for length followed by DEFINITION

An DEFINITION has 2 parts:
the DEFINITION TEXT as a string preceded by 2 bytes for length
the ALTERNATIVES as a string preceded by 1 byte for length
